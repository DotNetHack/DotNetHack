## Storyline

> Under the shadow of Cape-Split, a monstrous outcropping of sheer stone, where the stormy waters of the Minas Basin collide with the rising tides of the Bay of Fundy - there lies the bustling merchant towne of Wolfville. A village on the frontier of the great divide, it's stategic importance cannot be underestimated.  Blacksmiths, shipbuilders, alchemists, villagers, shopkeepers and adventurers all call it home and have for generations.
